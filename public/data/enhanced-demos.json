    "description": "Discover how changing magnetic fields generate electric currents through Faraday's law.",
    "explanation": "Electromagnetic induction is the process by which a changing magnetic field generates an electric current in a conductor. This fundamental principle, discovered by Michael Faraday, forms the basis of generators, transformers, and many modern electrical devices. The induced EMF is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux.",
