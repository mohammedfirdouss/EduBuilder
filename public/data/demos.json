    "description": "Explore the periodic motion of a simple pendulum and understand factors affecting its period.",
    "explanation": "A simple pendulum consists of a mass suspended from a fixed point by a string or rod. When displaced from its equilibrium position, it oscillates back and forth under the influence of gravity. The period of oscillation depends primarily on the length of the pendulum and the acceleration due to gravity, while being largely independent of the mass and small amplitude of oscillation.",

Each parent contributes one allele for each gene. Dominant alleles mask recessive alleles. Mendel's laws describe patterns of inheritance, including segregation and independent assortment.",
